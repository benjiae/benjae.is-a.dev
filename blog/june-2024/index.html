        <p>hi!!!! this is my first "blog-thing" thing i think, so let's go with the actual stuff!!!</p>

        <p>things are going fine, i've done an <a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obscurrentsong-spotify.658/">OBSCurrentSong</a>-like thing but for <a href="https://last.fm">last.fm</a> since that one is exclusively for spotify and i wanted to do it on something else!!! <a href="https://github.com/benjiae/lastfm-currentsong">here's the link</a>, and <a href="/blog/assets/lastfm-currentsongdemo.mp4">here's a demostration video!</a></p>

        <p>i also remade the <a href="https://benjae.nekoweb.org">main site</a>!! i'm more content on how this one looks, and it started using <a href="https://tepiloxtl.net/scrobbled/">this thing that i found on the nekoweb discord server</a> for showing what i'm listening to, it's pretty cool i think (thanks tepiloxtl!!)</p>

        <p>Idk why but i'm thinking about getting a domain for some reason, like i don't even know what am i gonna do with it but i just feel like it would be cool to have one</p>

        <p>I'm also thinking about installing linux again, maybe there'll be an update on that!! (if i don't forget to do it)</p>

        <p>And for the final thing, I also got to E05 on TMNF!!! (some tracks were horrible), i'm NOT doing it because it's 1 hour long but i got there!!!</p>
