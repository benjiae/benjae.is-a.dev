# trying to use aya
2024-10-15

## Why
you know the deal, i wanted to try something and somehow got it to work

## What even is Aya
[Aya](https://suzunaan.chaotic.ninja/aya/) is a static site generator with the name of a touhou character (that's why i decided to try it ðŸ”¥)
i discovered it on [Devi's site](https://tengu.space/) (which the source helped me figure out how to do some stuff (thanks))

## ok so how do you use it
i'd put the process here but the repo already explains the basic things, to bundle stuff with the site you put the files on ``.pub``, and to use a layout you make the ``.aya/layout.html`` file, and [that should be it i think](/assets/blog/aya-1/screenshot.png)

I do have to enter wsl every time i want to use it but it can't be *that* bad right [^1]

i wanted an excuse to write something and yeah here you are

thanks for reading!!!

[^1]: i got it working on windows a few hours later!!!
