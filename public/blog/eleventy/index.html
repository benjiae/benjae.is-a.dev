<h2>why</h2>
<p>Hi! as you might see i deleted the other one because i was too lazy to port it to the new site, now that i've seen 11ty being mentioned on nekoweb i decided to try it.</p>
<h2>installing and using it</h2>
<p>idk man it's just <code>npm install @11ty/eleventy</code> (i have fucked this up and installed <code>eleventy</code> instead of <code>@11ty/eleventy</code> but shhhh)</p>
<p>I did configure it to get the files from <code>src/</code> instead of the root, and to output on <code>idk-a-blog-maybe/</code> instead of <code>_site/</code></p>
<p>To get text, i literally created an <code>index.md</code>, put some stuff on it, ran <code>npx @11ty/eleventy</code> and i was done <br>
Now, this is the part where i started searching:</p>
<p>Getting a layout (because i'm not going to modify the index.html manually) to work was pretty easy, i just copied the index.html from the main site, removed unnecesary stuff and put it on <code>src/_includes/layout.njk</code> (<a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/layouts/">thanks documentation (link)</a>)</p>
<p>To get css (and the global assets) working, I put the folders on the root and yeah you get it <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/copy/">i also followed the documentation (link)</a> to import the <code>css</code> and <code>assets</code> folders, figuring out the directory where i had to import stuff from was trial and error tho, <a href="screenshot.png">but it works! (image)</a></p>
<p>To get non-global assets working i did the same but instead of <code>eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy(&quot;assets/&quot;);</code> i put <code>eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy(&quot;src/*/*.png&quot;);</code> on my <code>.eleventy.js</code> file</p>
<p>so yeah, that's it, i just did this to try how 11ty actually worked and it's pretty good! i'll probably experiment more with it later</p>
