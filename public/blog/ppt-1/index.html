<p>2024-11-03</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>So i decided to buy it, seeing that it was like $3 on steam!!!</p>

<h2 id="my-experience">My experience</h2>

<p>It was pretty good!! i still have to 100% the adventure and stuff but i&rsquo;ve at least finished the any%</p>

<p>My playtime is not accurate because i played the 3ds version at some moment in time but steam says it took <a href="steam-playtime.png">around 7 hours</a> (including online)</p>

<p>As i am (sadly) a tetris main, i destroyed the things where you play tetris and got destroyed on the things where you play with puyos (man i really want to get good at puyo)</p>

<p>As for the &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; clear it&rsquo;s because i thought there was a chapter 8 based on the clear % (it was on 93%), so when i finished 7-10 the <a href="stream-chat.png">Historian achievement told me something</a></p>

<p>Since i&rsquo;m still at <sup>14</sup>&frasl;<sub>42</sub> achievements i still have a long way to go, and <a href="steam-cleaner.png">i sure</a> <a href="steam-chain.png">need to</a> gamble on some achievements (puzzle league too!!)</p>

<p>Pretty good game! I will keep playing it</p>
